This is a demo for a Codeship & Docker presentation for NDev.

## NDev 6 - Continuous Integration with Codeship and Docker

This month we'll be learning a bit about DevOps and Continuous Integration from Chesley Brown! Chesley is currently a full stack developer at InVision and has been working in the tech industry as a professional since 2007.

Chesley will be giving a talk entitled "Docker on Codeship - It's Pretty Awesome"

which will explain how you can use Codeshipâ€™s new Docker offering to achieve your continuous integration dreams!

Afterwards, as always, feel free to hang around for some food, drink, and conversation with your fellow developers. We look forward to seeing you there!

Note: This meetup will be happening on Tuesday May 31, not on a Monday as is usual. Turns out Bitter's has Mondays already booked for most of the summer.
